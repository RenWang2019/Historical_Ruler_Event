 historical_leaders_mod.2.t:0 "Reign of Süleyman the Magnificent"
 historical_leaders_mod.2.d:0 "Known as Süleyman the Magnificent but also, especially among Muslims, as Süleyman the Just and Süleyman the Lawgiver, Ottoman power reached its zenith and became a world power under his rule. His rule represented one of the most just and orderly periods of Ottoman history. Like most rulers of the time, he was on the one hand ruthless in dealing with those he regarded as a threat to his own plans for success, but on the other hand, unlike many, he had a profound concern for justice. He codified the law to guard against corruption, which he was determined to root out. Many Muslims regard him as an example of the ideal or model ruler. Although the empire continued to expand for a century after his death, this period was followed by a very long decline mainly due to his successors' indifference toward good governance. On the borders of his empire, territorial expansion and hostility with competing powers meant that life was unstable, but for many within the empire, including minorities, the reality was a Pax Ottomanica. Süleyman can properly be regarded as one of history's more humane rulers who had a dual sense of obligation and responsibility to God and to society."

Internationally, in a series of wars between 1667 and 1697, he extended France’s eastern borders at the expense of the Habsburgs and then, in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14), engaged a hostile European coalition in order to secure the Spanish throne for his grandson."

 historical_leaders_mod.10.d:0 "Ivan the Terrible, Russian Ivan Grozny, byname of Ivan Vasilyevich, also called Ivan IV, grand prince of Moscow and the first to be proclaimed tsar of Russia. His reign saw the completion of the construction of a centrally administered Russian state and the creation of an empire that included non-Slav states. Ivan engaged in prolonged and largely unsuccessful wars against Sweden and Poland, and, in seeking to impose military discipline and a centralized administration, he instituted a reign of terror against the hereditary nobility. In 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law, Yelena Sheremeteva, for wearing immodest clothing, which may have caused a miscarriage. His second son, also named Ivan, upon learning of that, engaged in a heated argument with his father, which resulted in Ivan striking his son in the head with his pointed staff and fatally wounding him."

 historical_leaders_mod.12.d:0 "In common parlance, the wives of Henry VIII were the six queens consort wedded to Henry between 1509 and his death in 1547. In legal terms, King Henry VIII of England had only three wives, because three of his marriages were annulled by the Church of England. However, he was never granted an annulment by the Pope, as he desired, for Catherine of Aragon, his first wife. Annulments declare that a true marriage never took place, unlike a divorce, in which a married couple end their union. Along with his six wives, Henry took several mistresses."

She is best known for her vigorous attempt to reverse the English Reformation, which had begun during the reign of her father, Henry VIII. Her attempt to restore to the Church the property confiscated in the previous two reigns was largely thwarted by Parliament, but during her five-year reign, Mary had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake in the Marian persecutions."

Now, however, it is well and truly a Protestant cesspool. It's false Lords and Ladies sit upon thrones of lies in holdings which find their legitimacy in the words and actions of heretics. We must liberate England from its squalor."

 historical_leaders_mod.17.d:0 "Elizabeth I was Queen of England and Ireland from 17 November 1558 until her death in 1603. Sometimes called the Virgin Queen, Gloriana or Good Queen Bess, Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the House of Tudor. Daughter of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, she displayed precocious seriousness as a child and received the rigorous education normally reserved for male heirs. Her situation was precarious during the reigns of her half brother Edward VI and her half sister Mary I. After Sir Thomas Wyatt’s rebellion in 1554, she was imprisoned but later released. Her accession to the throne on Mary’s death was greeted with public jubilation. She assembled a core of experienced advisers, including William Cecil and Francis Walsingham, but she zealously retained her power to make final decisions. Important events of her reign included the restoration of England to Protestantism; the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots; and England’s defeat of the Spanish Armada. She lived under constant threat of conspiracies by British Catholics. Over time she became known as the Virgin Queen, wedded to her kingdom. Many important suitors came forward, and she showed signs of romantic attachment to the earl of Leicester, but she remained single, perhaps because she was unwilling to compromise her power. She had another suitor, the 2nd earl of Essex, executed in 1601 for treason. Though her later years saw an economic decline and disastrous military efforts to subdue the Irish, her reign had already seen England’s emergence as a world power and her presence had helped unify the nation against foreign enemies. Highly intelligent and strong-willed, Elizabeth inspired ardent expressions of loyalty, and her reign saw a brilliant flourishing in the arts, especially literature and music. After her death, she was succeeded by James I."

 historical_leaders_mod.23.d:0 "Following the death of Polish King John III Sobieski and having converted to Catholicism, Augustus won election as King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1697 with the backing of Imperial Russia and Austria, which financed him through the banker Berend Lehmann. At the time, some questioned the legality of Augustus' elevation, since another candidate, François Louis, Prince of Conti, had received more votes. Each candidate, Conti and Augustus, was proclaimed as king by a different ecclesiastical authority: (the Primate Michaŀ Radziejowski proclaimed Conti and the bishop of Kujawy, Stanisław Dąmbski proclaimed Augustus, with Jacob Heinrich von Flemming swearing to the pacta conventa as Augustus's proxy). However, Augustus hurried to the Commonwealth with a Saxon army, while Conti stayed in France for two months."

 historical_leaders_mod.26.d:0 "Peter the Great was a Russian czar in the late 17th century who is best known for his extensive reforms in an attempt to establish Russia as a great nation. He created a strong navy, reorganized his army according to Western standards, secularized schools, administered greater control over the reactionary Orthodox Church and introduced new administrative and territorial divisions of the country. Peter focused on the development of science and recruited several experts to educate his people about technological advancements. He concentrated on developing commerce and industry and created a gentrified bourgeoisie population. Mirroring Western culture, he modernized the Russian alphabet, introduced the Julian calendar and established the first Russian newspaper. Peter acquired territory in Estonia, Latvia and Finland; and through several wars with Turkey in the south, he secured access to the Black Sea. In 1709, he defeated the Swedish army by purposely directing their troops to the city of Poltava, in the midst of an unbearable Russian winter. In 1712, Peter established the city of St. Petersburg on the Neva River and moved the capital there from its former location in Moscow. Shortly after, St. Petersburg was deemed Russia's "window to Europe.""

 historical_leaders_mod.28.d:0 "Charles XII of Sweden was the king of Sweden from 1697 to 1718. He was the second child and the first son of Charles XI of Sweden and Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark. Charles XII spent his childhood amidst luxury. As a child, he was a keen observer of the political and military matters of his kingdom, while preparing to rule the kingdom someday. His father passed away in 1697. Hence, Charles XII inherited the throne of Sweden. He was 15 years old when he took charge after a 7-month rule by a caretaker government. In 1700, he faced his first big challenge as a king when Sweden was attacked by three neighborhood kingdoms, who wished to take advantage of a weakened country and a young and inexperienced king. The war that resulted was known as the Great Northern War. However, Charles exhibited great military prowess and emerged victorious in several battles despite his forces being severely outnumbered. He claimed victory for his Empire in the name of Sweden and God, and survived to see the end of the war, despite leading it personally and nearly being killed on the battlefield on several occasions. He was hailed by the historians as a great military commander and an able politician."

A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime; he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover in 1708. After the deaths in 1714 of his mother, and his second cousin Anne, Queen of Great Britain, George ascended the British throne as Anne's closest living Protestant relative under the Act of Settlement 1701.

'Der Alte Fritz' (meaning 'Old Fritz') as often called by the people of Prussia, he was successful in reorganizing the Prussian army. His leadership not only made Prussia a prominent military power but also one of the greatest states in Europe. He succeeded in the ‘Seven Years’ War’ overcoming great odds. An advocate of enlightened absolutism, he reformed the civil, bureaucratic and judicial system and pursued different religious policies in Prussia though remained prejudiced about the Jews. His reign saw appointments of senior bureaucrats and judges even if they were not of noble origin. He claimed several territories of Poland during the ‘First Partition of Poland’. He remained an icon for the Nazis who glorified him as a great German leader pre-Hitler. He was a great patron of art and architecture but also imposed laws to censor the press. His reign saw construction of several buildings including Berlin State Opera and the palace of Sanssouci among others. A great music lover, he could play the transverse flute and composed several sonatas and symphonies. As he was issueless, his nephew Frederick William II succeeded him."

 historical_leaders_mod.33.d:0 "Peter, who was mentally feeble and extremely pro-Prussian, not only alienated the affections of his wife soon after their marriage but also failed to gain the favour of politically powerful court cliques. His popularity diminished further after he succeeded Elizabeth and, reversing her foreign policy, made peace with Prussia and withdrew from the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), formed an alliance with Prussia, and prepared to engage Russia in a war against Denmark to help his native Holstein gain control of Schleswig. Even when he relieved the gentry of their obligation to serve the state (March 1, 1762), he did not gain supporters. When he offended the Russian Orthodox Church by trying to force it to adopt Lutheran religious practices and also alienated the imperial guards by making their service requirements more severe and threatening to disband them, Catherine, who suspected that he was planning to divorce her, conspired with her lover Grigory Grigoryevich Orlov and other members of the guard to overthrow him."

 historical_leaders_mod.34.d:0 "Peter was officially overthrown on June 28, 1762 when Catherine and Orlov mounted a coup, leading 14,000 soldiers on horseback to the Winter Palace and forcing Peter to sign abdication paperwork. He was immediately jailed. What is known is that Peter died shortly after being overthrown and jailed, around July 17, 1762. It's widely believed that he was assassinated behind bars, and that Alexei Orlov, Grigory's brother, was the killer. What remains most unclear is whether Catherine herself was aware of any assassination plot–or indeed whether she ordered it–there's even some evidence that Peter committed suicide. But across Europe, Catherine was generally blamed nonetheless."

 historical_leaders_mod.35.d:0 "During Catherine the Great’s reign, Russia was expanding rapidly due to both diplomacy and conquest; as a result of this expansion, Russian borders spread as far as the Black Sea and Central Europe. Catherine the Great strongly supported both modernization and westernization, an endeavor started by her husband prior to his death. Catherine was also a great proponent of the Enlightenment in Europe, and she promoted the education of Russian citizens. As Catherine aged, she became more conservative in her rule. She continued to rely heavily on the nobility, however, and initiated reforms that would give the nobility more power and control of their lands and the serfs that worked them. As a result, a number of rebellions by serfs occurred during this time period, but the end result was further restrictions on the rights of the serfs and a more diminished status. After her death, her son, Paul, took the throne."

The son of a prosperous planter, Washington was raised in colonial Virginia. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor then fought in the French and Indian War (1754-63). During the American Revolution, he led the colonial forces to victory over the British and became a national hero. In 1787, he was elected president of the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution. Two years later, Washington became America’s first president. Realizing that the way he handled the job would impact how future presidents approached the position, he handed down a legacy of strength, integrity and national purpose. Less than three years after leaving office, he died at his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, at age 67."
